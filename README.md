DOCUMENTATION -

Step 1 > DualBoot your system. (this Youtube video was useful - https://youtu.be/u5QyjHIYwTQ )

Step 2 > Install ROS and setup a workspace . (The best resource for this is ROS Wiki - http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials ) 
       -Create a workspace folder (usually "catkin_ws") .
       -Create a folder inside the workspace folder named "src" .
       -Go back to the workspace folder and Run - catkin_make .
       -Put the newly created "build" and "devel" folders inside .gitignore .
       -Source the setup.bash file from the devel folder either by using the source command or by editing the .bashrc .



P.S - I have had Ubuntu for quite a while and I have forgotton the problems that I have faced .
      Same goes for ROS , I have worked on it for Simulations in Gazebo and Running my Bot so I couldn't remember much of the initial problems that I faced .
      Sorry for the lackluster Documentation .
